ALGORITHM DESIGN AND
ANALYSIS
General Information of Example Classes
The learning objectives of example classes are to apply, design and analyse algorithms. Students
will train their practical skills in implementation, empirical analysis, presentation, and team
collaboration.
[Weightage] There will be 3 example classes, each of 2 hours. Each example class contains a
mini-project. The performance of a student in the example classes will constitute 20% of his/her
final marks for the course, with each example class carrying equal weights.
[Project Grouping] Students will be allocated into groups each of 2 – 3 members. The group
allocation will be done by the lab supervisor and released to the students at the lab course site
@NTULearn.
[Assessment] Each project will be assessed the following components and each component’s
grading percentage is given below:
Components Percentage
Correctness:
Algorithm,
Implementation
40%
Analysis:
Theoretically and
Empirically
40%
Presentation 20%
Students in the same group should work together to complete the projects. In general, all
members of the same group will be given the same grade for each project. However, the lab
supervisor can award a student with outstanding performance a higher grade than the group
grade, if he/she finds it justified. On the other hand, if a student makes little contribution to the
group (such as, not actively participating in the project), the lab supervisor can deduct his/her
marks.
[Project Presentation] Before the lab class, each group should have finished the coding
and testing of programs (in any programming languages, e.g., Python, Java, C++, C, etc.)
on their own computers.
Each group has 10 minutes to present their work and give demonstrations, including Q&A.
Students should fully utilise the given time to let your lab supervisor understand your work. NO
additional time will be given to any group. Each team member is required to be familiar with the
whole project as the lab supervisor can choose any one of you to answer some questions in Q&A.
It will be considered as a part of the assessment under presentation.
It is compulsory for students to attend their project presentations. If a student is absent from
the presentation without a valid justification (e.g., MC), he/she will receive zero mark for that
project. If a student is on MC for more than 2 lab sessions, his/her whole example classes (20%
of the course) will be marked MC and the percentage will go into the final exam.
[Work Submission] No submission is required for lab projects
